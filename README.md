# Chat-Server-Client by Emil Hultcrantz
A simple chat server and client. Based on the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html) and [example by Viola SÃ¶derlund](https://github.com/INDAPlus21/AssignmentInstructions/tree/master/sockets-task-14/rust-example)

## How to run

* Clone repo
* Start server with `cargo run --bin server`
* Start client (in a diffrent terminal) with `cargo run --bin client`. (Each client requires a new terminal)
